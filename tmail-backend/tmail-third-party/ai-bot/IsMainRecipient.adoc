=== IsMainRecipient

The `IsMainRecipient` matcher selects only the recipients that are explicitly listed
in the message `To:` header. It is useful when you want a mailet to act only for
recipients that are the primary targets of the message (as opposed to `Cc` or
`Bcc` recipients or recipients added by envelope-level routing).

=== Configuration

This matcher does not require any special parameters.

Example:
....
<mailet match="com.linagora.tmail.matcher.IsMainRecipient" class="LlmMailet"/>
....
