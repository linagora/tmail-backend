= JMAP AI Chat Completion

This extension allows to call the RAG (that calls the LLM) to do some chat completion (for the Scribe UI).

The route is only a simple proxy. Tmail-backend does not treat anything, it just forwards the initial request to
the RAG and then forwards the response back to the client.

== Additions to the capability object

Servers supporting the JMAP AI Chat Completion extension need to advertise it through the session capabilities:
....
com:linagora:params:jmap:aibot
....

The associated object has the following field:

- `scribeEndpoint`: *URL*. The url endpoint associated for scribe AI chat completion. By default, it should
be "http://[jmap_endpoint]/ai/v1/chat/completions"
