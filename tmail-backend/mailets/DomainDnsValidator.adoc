= DomainDnsValidator
:navtitle: DomainDnsValidator

== Purpose

The `DomainDnsValidator` mailet validates DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) for outbound emails before sending them.
This is particularly useful in SaaS environments where customers send emails through your infrastructure using their own domains.

The mailet ensures that:

* *DKIM*: The DKIM selector used in the email signature has a valid DNS record published
* *SPF*: The domain's SPF record authorizes your server IPs to send emails on behalf of the domain
* *DMARC*: The domain has a DMARC policy with at least the minimum required strictness level

If any validation fails, the email is rejected with an appropriate error message.

== Workflow

1. The email is DKIM-signed by the `DKIMSign` mailet
2. `DomainDnsValidator` extracts the DKIM signature information (domain and selector)
3. DNS records are validated according to configuration
4. If all checks pass, the email proceeds to delivery
5. If any check fails, the email is bounced with an error message

== Configuration

=== Placement

This mailet should be placed in the *transport processor*, after `DKIMSign` and before `RemoteDelivery`.

== Validation Details

=== DKIM Validation

The mailet:

1. Extracts the `s=` (selector) and `d=` (domain) parameters from the `DKIM-Signature` header
2. Queries DNS for `<selector>._domainkey.<domain>` TXT record
3. Verifies the record exists and starts with `v=DKIM1`

*Example*: For `s=s1; d=example.com`, expects a TXT record at `s1._domainkey.example.com`:

[source]
----
s1._domainkey.example.com. IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb..."
----

=== SPF Validation

The mailet:

1. Queries DNS for the domain's TXT records
2. Locates the SPF record (starts with `v=spf1`)
3. Verifies all IPs listed in `spfAuthorizedIps` are present in the SPF record
4. Additional IPs in the SPF record are tolerated (customers can authorize their own servers too)

*Example*: For `spfAuthorizedIps=192.0.2.10,198.51.100.5`, expects:

[source]
----
example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.10 ip4:198.51.100.5 ~all"
----

Or with CIDR notation:

[source]
----
example.com. IN TXT "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ip4:198.51.100.0/24 ~all"
----

=== DMARC Validation

The mailet:

1. Queries DNS for `_dmarc.<domain>` TXT record
2. Verifies the record exists and starts with `v=DMARC1`
3. Extracts the `p=` (policy) parameter
4. Verifies the policy meets the minimum requirement set in `dmarcMinPolicy`

*Policy hierarchy* (from lenient to strict):

* `none` (0)
* `quarantine` (1)
* `reject` (2)

*Example*: For `dmarcMinPolicy=quarantine`, both of these are valid:

[source]
----
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com"
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com"
----

But this would fail:

[source]
----
_dmarc.example.com. IN TXT "v=DMARC1; p=none"
----

== Error Handling

When validation fails, the email is:

* Set to `ERROR` state
* Given an error message describing the failure
* Typically bounced back to the sender with an explanation

Error messages include:

* DKIM: "No DKIM record found at s1._domainkey.example.com"
* SPF: "SPF record for domain example.com is missing required IPs: 192.0.2.10"
* DMARC: "DMARC policy for domain example.com is too lenient. Required: quarantine, Found: none"

== Use Cases

=== SaaS Email Platform

In a SaaS environment where multiple customers use your platform to send emails using their own domains:

1. Customer adds their domain to your platform
2. Customer configures DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) according to your documentation
3. When customer sends email, `DomainDnsValidator` verifies their DNS is configured correctly
4. If misconfigured, email is rejected with clear error message
5. Customer fixes their DNS and retries

This prevents:

* Emails being sent from domains without proper authentication
* Damage to your server's reputation
* Emails being rejected/marked as spam by recipient servers

=== Internal Compliance

For organizations that require strict email authentication policies, this mailet ensures:

* All outbound emails have proper DKIM signatures published in DNS
* SPF records authorize the correct sending servers
* DMARC policies meet minimum security requirements

== Testing

To test the configuration:

1. Set up test DNS records
2. Send a test email
3. Check logs for validation results
4. Intentionally misconfigure DNS to verify rejection works

[source,bash]
----
# Check DKIM record
dig TXT s1._domainkey.example.com

# Check SPF record
dig TXT example.com

# Check DMARC record
dig TXT _dmarc.example.com
----

== Troubleshooting

=== Email rejected: "No DKIM-Signature header found"

*Cause*: Email was not DKIM-signed before validation

*Solution*: Ensure `DKIMSign` mailet is placed before `DomainDnsValidator` in mailetcontainer.xml

=== Email rejected: "SPF record missing required IPs"

*Cause*: Domain's SPF record doesn't include your server IPs

*Solution*: Customer needs to update their SPF record to include the IPs listed in `spfAuthorizedIps`

=== Email rejected: "DMARC policy too lenient"

*Cause*: Domain has `p=none` but `dmarcMinPolicy=quarantine` is required

*Solution*: Customer needs to update their DMARC record to `p=quarantine` or `p=reject`

=== DNS query failures

*Cause*: DNS server unreachable or domain doesn't exist

*Solution*: Check network connectivity and verify domain is correctly configured
