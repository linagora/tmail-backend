= TMail ethic
:navtitle: Our ethic


image::pillars.png[Linagora development pillars]

At Linagora we write reliable software, private and secure, opensource, and that respect the planet.
We do not just write software. We write **ethical software**.

This page details what this means to us, and provides concrete actions that we did undertake.

== Design Open Standards

We believe in an Open internet structured by open standards, designed collaboratively,
and enabling **inter-operability**.

image::open-standards.jpeg[Open Standards]

We have been involved for years  within the link:https://www.ietf.org/[IETF] on the standardisation
efforts around the link:https://jmap.io/[JMAP] protocol. Active on the mailing list, we are amongst the
first implementors. By sharing our feedback, we believe we helped making JMAP a better specification.

We also wrote link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9007/[RFC-9007] Handling Message Disposition Notification
with the JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP).

We also promote a link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-jmap-quotas/[draft] regarding quota management with JMAP.

== OpenSource, everywhere

We believe OpenSource embodies a third, independent digital way, enabling **co-innovation**, and empowering trust.

image::open-source.png[Open Source]

As such, we are only writing OpenSource software. Yes. Only OpenSource. All of our main components are licensed with the
**AGPL** Linagora license.

This is a list of our repositories licensed with the **AGPL** license:

- link:https://github.com/linagora/tmail-backend/[TMail backend]
- link:https://github.com/linagora/tmail-flutter[TMail mobile]
- link:https://github.com/linagora/esn-frontend-inbox[OpenPaaS INBOX]

== Contribute back!

We believe that OpenSource is not just about the license! We are fully aware we are part of an eco-system and that our
contributions might have a broader reach when performed on projects owned by third parties.

image::contribute.png[Contribute]

 - We are active contributors, and the main maintainers of the link:https://james.apache.org[Apache James] project.
 - We also share with the community our JMAP libraries under more permissive licences (MIT), actively used by the JMAP community:
    - link:https://github.com/linagora/jmap-dart-client[jmap-dart-client] A link:https://jmap.io/[JMAP] client for the link:https://dart.dev/[Dart] programming language and the link:https://flutter.dev/[Flutter] framework.
    - link:https://github.com/linagora/jmap-client-ts[jmap-client-ts] A link:https://jmap.io/[JMAP] client for the link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] programming language.
    - link:https://github.com/linagora/jmap-draft-client[jmap-draft-client] A JavaScript client for JMAP pre-standardisation drafts.

In addition to this we always report defects we might find in third party libraries, and if we are able to, we also propose
fixes for it. We try to have a positive impact on the projects we depend on.

== Respect projects governance

Strong communities are built on top of a predicatble decision making. We believe without a clear governance process
communities cannot grow.

image::governance.jpeg[Governance]

While we want to keep governance on our TMail product, we want to be able to collaborate with people with diverging views.
We do not want to push our roadmap and our feature, and impose them to third party communities. Thus, with TMail software
structure, we can extend, or even replace on a fin grain basis components provided by third parties, and adapt them to our needs
without impacting negatively the communities.

As part of our interactions with the link:https://www.apache.org/[Apache Fundation] we fully embrasse the
link:http://www.apache.org/theapacheway/[Apache way].

For TMail components, we regularly publish a link:roadmap.adoc[roadmap], in order to people to understand where we are heading.

Furthermore, we would be delighted to discuss your needs and see how it can fit in our roadmap. link:contribute.adoc[Contributions] are welcome.

== Promote education

We believe that as professional we need to engage ourselves and transmit what we know. We believe knowledge sharing is
at the heart of OpenSource.

The team behind TMail loves to share!

 - We maintain a link:https://medium.com/linagora-engineering[blog] where we share our expertise about TMail and on the
technologies surrounding it.
 - We have an **internship** program. Internship is often the first step for students into professional life, and the best
opportunity to transmit our values, our knowledge. We ensure the best possible knowledge environement for our interns, on
OpenSource projects.
 - We join other initiatives like the link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer Of Code] which promotes
OpenSource. In 2021, we for instance were accepted on a topic about **message threads**.
 - We collaborate with Academic. We have a partnership with the polytechnic schoole of Hanoi (SOICT) and have been teeching
there the link:https://www.schoolandcollegelistings.com/VN/Hanoi/1673064029649116/Open-Up---Bach-Khoa-Hanoi[OpenUp] tutoring
program.
 - We organise talks within our office, for instance through the **Open Tech Talk** initiative in Hanoi.

== Thoughts for the planet

We are aware of the climate emergency, and of the ecological impact of the IT industry.

image::planet.png[Linagora: sustainable logo]

We believe that by having a strong collaborative suite we can help to limit in-person transit, and thus help to
indirectly limit carbon emissions.

Also when faced with a technological choice, we try to account for the carbon footprint. For instance, we chose
link:https://jmap.io[JMAP] protocol as it limits bandwidth costs of email re-synchronisations, limits network roundtrips.
His cleaner data model (when compared to alternative Open standards) means less queries to our databases, and thus reduced
energy consumption.

== Privacy

We believe it is our responsibility to keep your data safe!

image::lock.png[Encrypted mailbox]

In addition of being link:https://gdpr-info.eu/[GDPR] compliant, we take it one step further by allowing you to
encrypt your data using the link:tmail-backend/features/encrypted-mailbox.adoc[Encrypted Mailbox].

Privacy goes hand in hand with security. We do use link:https://app.snyk.io/[Snyk] to monitor our dependencies and docker
images. We regularily perform some security audits, for instance using link:https://github.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/jazzer[fuzzing].
