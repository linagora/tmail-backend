:navtitle: TMail Mobile application

The link:[tmail-flutter] project aims at providing a multi-plateform mobile email application, running the JMAP protocol
and will also deliver additional features to the TMail back-end.

Here is how TMail looks like on a tablet:

== Why did you choose JMAP?

**IMAP** is THE ubiquitous protocol people use to read their emails, THE norm.

Yet IMAP had been designed in another age, which resulted in a chatty patchwork
of extensions. IMAP lacks decent synchronisation primitives to address real-time
challenges modern mobile fleet requires, it consumes a lot of bandwith, requires a
lot of roundtrips which means high latency.

We are not alone to say this! Big players of the field started their own link:https://developers.google.com/gmail/api[proprietary]
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients/exchange-activesync/exchange-activesync?view=exchserver-2019[protocols]
to address IMAP flaws, and inter-operable standard was yet to be found...

This, is where link:https://jmap.io[JMAP] comes to play! JMAP builds on decades of experience,
and beautifully addresses these challenges using `HTTP` and `JSON` standards. Not only does it make
applications easier to develop, we also strongly believes it results in an improved experience for
the end user.

== Inter-operability

You can use the TMail application with any JMAP server and benefits from Tmail ergonomy and ease of use.

We will test TMail mobile application against **FastMail** servers to ensure this.

== Targeted platforms

First, we target Android, IOS mobiles. We also take care of tablets and large rendering space early on in the development process.

Then, we plan on introducing a desktop application.

This versatility is enabled by the use of the link:https://flutter.dev/[Flutter] framework.
