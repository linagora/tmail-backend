= JMAP TeamMailboxMember Extension
:navtitle: JMAP TeamMailboxMember

This extension allows users to manage members of team mailboxes (view members, add members, remove members, promote members).

== Additions to the capability object

Servers supporting the JMAP TeamMailboxMember extension need to advertise it through the session capabilities:

....
com:linagora:params:jmap:team:mailboxes
....

The associated object is empty.

== TeamMailboxMember object

We introduce the `TeamMailboxMember` object representing the information of members of a team mailbox, which contains these properties:

 * **id**: `Id`. Server-set. Team mailbox name of the mailbox.
 * **members**: `String[Role]`. A JSON object where the keys are usernames (as strings) and the values are `Role` objects.

The `Role` JSON object has the following properties:

 * **role**: `String`. The role of a member within the team mailbox. Possible values include `manager`, `member`.
    ** `member` can view members of the team mailboxes that her has access to.
    ** `manager` can view members of the team mailboxes that her has access to, add members, remove members and promote `member` to `manager`.

                    {
                        "id": "teammailboxA@domain.tld",
                        "members": {
                            "bob@domain.tld": {

                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            "#0"
        ]
    ]
}
```

== TeamMailboxMember/set

This method bases on the update part of the standard */set* method as described in Section 5.3, RFC8620.

This method allows only members with the `manager` role updating the members of a team mailbox by adding, removing and promoting members.

If non `manager` members try to use this method, the update MUST be rejected with a `forbidden` SetError.

=== Example

The following request adds Cedric to the team mailbox, remove Alice from the team mailbox and promote Bob to a manager of the team mailbox.
