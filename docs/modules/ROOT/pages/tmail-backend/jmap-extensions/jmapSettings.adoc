= JMAP Settings
:navtitle: JMAP Settings

This extension allows clients to store per-user settings on the backend side.

== Additions to the capability object

Servers supporting the JMAP Settings extension need to advertise it through the session capabilities:
....
com:linagora:params:jmap:settings
....

The associated object has the following field:

- `readOnlyProperties`: *List[String]*. List of read-only properties the client cannot edit.

== Settings object

The `Settings` object represents a list of settings per-user used by clients to store some of their user related
configuration on the backend server.

It has the following fields:

- *id*: `Id` (immutable; server-set) The id of the object. There is only ever one Settings object,
and its id is "singleton".
- *settings*: `String[String]` Map of settings set by the client. Most of the settings are proper to what the client
needs to store on the backend, but some can be also known for some automation on the backend for a particular user
regarding TMail applications.

Example:

....
{
  "id":"singleton",
  "settings": {
    "tdrive.attachment.import.enabled": "true",
    "firebase.enabled": "true",
    "timezone": "UTC+7",
    "trash.cleanup.enabled": "true",
    "trash.cleanup.period": "weekly",
    "language": "fr",
    [...]
  }
}
....

== Methods

=== Settings/get

This is a standard “/get” method for the Settings object:

- There MUST only be exactly one Settings object in an account. It MUST have the id “singleton”.

=== Settings/set

This is a standard `/set` method for the Settings object:

- As this is a singleton object, `create` and `destroy` are not supported.
- Attempts to modify read-only settings (as listed in the `readOnlyProperties` capability property) will be rejected.
