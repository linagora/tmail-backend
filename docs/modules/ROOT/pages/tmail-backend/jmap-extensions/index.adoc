= TMail JMAP extensions
:navtitle: TMail JMAP extensions

TMail uses JMAP as a protocol for all the user facing interactions.

== Why did you choose JMAP?

**IMAP** is THE ubiquitous protocol people use to read their emails, THE norm.

Yet IMAP had been designed in another age, which resulted in a chatty patchwork
of extensions. IMAP lacks decent synchronisation primitives to address real-time
challenges modern mobile fleet requires, it consumes a lot of bandwith, requires a
lot of roundtrips which means high latency.

We are not alone to say this! Big players of the field started their own link:https://developers.google.com/gmail/api[proprietary]
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/clients/exchange-activesync/exchange-activesync?view=exchserver-2019[protocols]
to address IMAP flaws, and inter-operable standard was yet to be found...

This, is where link:https://jmap.io[JMAP] comes to play! JMAP builds on decades of experience,
and beautifully addresses these challenges using `HTTP` and `JSON` standards. Not only does it make
applications easier to develop, we also strongly believe it results in an improved experience for
the end user.

== TMail JMAP specifications

=== JMAP extensions for TMail

We introduce custom extensions to the main JMAP protocol in order to achieve our means. These extensions are documented here.

These extensions include:

- link:teamMailboxRevokeAccess.adoc[com:linagora:params:jmap:team:mailboxes] which adds the capability for users to revoke access to a team mailbox.
- link:pushWithFirebase.adoc[com:linagora:params:jmap:firebase:push] which adds the capability to manage push
notifications through Firebase Cloud Messaging.
- link:jmapGpgExtension.adoc[com:linagora:params:jmap:pgp] which adds the capability to read messages of TMail encrypted
mailbox.
 - link:ticketAuthentication.adoc[com:linagora:params:jmap:ws:ticket] allows to generate one time usage tickets in order
to authenticate webSocket connections using URI query parameters, as most browsers do not support setting `Authorization`
headers during the webSocket handshake.
 - link:jmapFilters.adoc[com:linagora:params:jmap:filter] allows user to specify message filters automating actions upon
message reception like moving them to a folder.
 - link:longLivedTokens.adoc[com:linagora:params:long:lived:token] enables a mechanism to safely authenticate mobile devices.
 - link:contactAutocomplete.adoc[com:linagora:params:jmap:contact:autocomplete] allows users, when composing an email,
to search recipients in his list of domain and personal contacts based on his input.

=== Standard JMAP extensions

We furthermore expose the following JMAP specifications in TMail (implemented in James):

 - link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8620[RFC-8620] JMAP Core defines mechanisms shared by all JMAP
specifications including download, uploads, event source.
 - link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8621[RFC-8621] JMAP Mail defines JMAP entities for emails and allows
building easily email applications.
 - link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8887[RFC-8887] allows JMAP to rely on webSockets as a transport layer.
 - link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9007[RFC-9007] JMAP MDN exposes convenient APIs for parsing, and sending
Message Delivery Notifications (Read receipts).

=== JMAP extensions from Apache James

Moreover, we do expose some JMAP extensions defined within Apache JAMES:

 - link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/protocols/jmap-rfc-8621/doc/specs/spec/quotas/quotas.mdown[urn:apache:james:params:jmap:mail:quota]
JMAP Quota (while waiting for the link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-jmap-quotas/[IETF draft] to be finalized) enables users to know their quotas for the Email related entities.
 - link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/protocols/jmap-rfc-8621/doc/specs/spec/mail/rights.mdown[urn:apache:james:params:jmap:mail:shares]
JMAP Sharing adds properties for a user to share access for their mailboxes to each other.

=== Additions to urn:apache:james:params:jmap:mail:shares

We add the `TeamMailbox` namespace to the `urn:apache:james:params:jmap:mail:shares` specification. It allows
a client application to identify that the mailbox is a team mailbox. The field carries the email address associated to the team mailbox.

Example:

....
...
"namespace": "TeamMailbox[marketing@domain.tld]",
...
....

== Authentication

JMAP RFC-8620 deliberately does not address authentication concerns, and only assumes authenticated requests are handled.

Here are authentication methods supported by TMail for JMAP related endpoints:

 - TMail supports link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[Basic Authentication] defined in
link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617[RFC-7617]. Please note that while convenient for testing purpose, this
authentication mechanism should not be used for production workflow: the credentials are transmitted again and over again,
should be retained in memory, authentication is challenged for each request...
 - TMail supports link:https://jwt.io/[JWT tokens] (link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519[RFC-7519]]) signed by third party
software, valid according to the configured JWT public key. If valid, the request is blindly trusted.
link:https://james.staged.apache.org/james-project/3.7.0/servers/distributed/configure/webadmin.html#_generating_a_jwt_key_pair[Read more]...
 - link:longLivedTokens.adoc[com:linagora:params:long:lived:token] enables a mechanism to safely authenticate mobile devices.
 - link:ticketAuthentication.adoc[com:linagora:params:jmap:ws:ticket] allows to generate one time usage tickets in order
to authenticate webSocket connections using URI query parameters, as most browsers do not support setting `Authorization`
headers during the webSocket handshake.

== Non goals and limitations

Please note that we do not plan to add support for link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-jmap-jscontact/[JMAP Contact]
and link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-jmap-calendars/[JMAP calendar] in TMail. There is a dedicated calendar/contact
software in the OpenPaaS suite.

Also, as a rule of thumb, while we try our best to follow all the standards:

 - We refrain ourselves to implement IETF drafts. Subject to frequent changes, this had proved to be very costly in the
past, and we would like not to do the same mistakes again.
 - We might have some limitations, naive behaviour, or even missing entities in our implementations. In fact the areas
covered by JMAP specifications is very large, and implementing them all perfectly is a tremendous task. While increasing
JMAP support is our ultimate goal, we have to accept intermediate steps where our implementation is partial. The Apache
JAMES project maintains an
link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/protocols/jmap-rfc-8621/doc/specs[annotated documentation]
clarifying these limitations.
