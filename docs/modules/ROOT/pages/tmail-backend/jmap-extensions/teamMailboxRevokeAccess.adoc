= Revoke access to a team mailbox
:navtitle: Revoke access to a team mailbox

Allows user to revoke his access to a team mailbox which he is part of without having to ask an admin to do such an action.

== Additions to the capability object

Servers supporting the revoking team mailbox access extension need to advertise this through the session capabilities:

....
com:linagora:params:jmap:team:mailboxes
....

The associated object is empty.

== TeamMailbox/revokeAccess

This method bases on the destroy part of standard */set* method as described in the RFC-8620 Section 5.3.

The request object requires the following properties:

- `accountId`: accountId of action user
- `ids`: an array of team-mailbox names which user wants to revoke the access to.

The response object contains the following properties:

- `accountId`: accountId of action user
- `revoked`: an array of team-mailbox names that have been revoked from user access.
- `notRevoked`: an array of team-mailbox names that have not been revoked from user access.

== Example

User A has access to `teammailboxA`. He wants to revoke his access to `teammailboxA` and even `teammailboxB` which he does not have access to:

....
{
	"using": ["urn:ietf:params:jmap:core", "urn:ietf:params:jmap:mail", "com:linagora:params:jmap:team:mailboxes"],
	"methodCalls": [
		["TeamMailbox/revokeAccess", {
			"accountId": "50fb9073ba109901291988b0d78e8a602a6fcd96fbde033eb46ca308779f8fac",
			"ids": ["teammailboxA@domain.tld", "teammailboxB@domain.tld"]
		}, "c0"]
	]
}
....

Which returns:

....
{
	"sessionState": "2c9f1b12-b35a-43e6-9af2-0106fb53a943",
	"methodResponses": [
		["TeamMailbox/revokeAccess", {
			"accountId": "50fb9073ba109901291988b0d78e8a602a6fcd96fbde033eb46ca308779f8fac",
			"revoked": ["teammailboxA@domain.tld"],
			"notRevoked": ["teammailboxB@domain.tld"]
		}, "#0"]
	]
}
....
