= TMail validate reception handler

The current `ValidRcptHandler` is used to verify whether a recipient exists on james server.
However, it does not support the validation of teamMailbox's addresses xref:tmail-backend/features/teamMailboxes.adoc[Read more].
Hence, we introduce a new `TMailValidRcptHandler` to resolve this issue.

== How to Use `TMailValidRcptHandler`
To use `TMailValidRcptHandler`, you need to declare it in the `smtpserver.xml` configuration file as follows:

```xml
<handlerchain coreHandlersPackage="com.linagora.tmail.smtp.TMailCmdHandlerLoader">
    <handler class="com.linagora.tmail.smtp.TMailValidRcptHandler"/>
</handlerchain>
```
