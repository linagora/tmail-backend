= SMTP Auth Delegation Extension

Allows delegated authentication through the `AUTH PLAIN` SMTP Command with two tokens.
This extension is similar to the SMTP `AUTH PLAIN` with three tokens (RFC 2595).

== Why is this extension needed?

According to RFC 2595, the client must send:
```
AUTH PLAIN base64_encoded_string([authorize-id]\0authenticate-id\0password)
```

However, impersonation of this is not supported by MUA (Mail User Agent).

== SMTP Command

The syntax will be:
```
AUTH PLAIN base64_encoded_string([authorize-id+authenticate-id]\0password)
```

Example:
```
AUTH PLAIN base64_encoded_string(secretary+minister@domain.tld\0secretary_password)
```

It is similar to the AUTH PLAIN command:
```
AUTH PLAIN base64_encoded_string(minister@domain.tld\0secretary@domain.tld\0secretary_password)
```

== How to deploy this extension

1. Enable `verifyIdentity` and `authRequired` in the `smtpserver.xml` file.
```
<authRequired>true</authRequired>
<verifyIdentity>true</verifyIdentity>
```

2. Define the `coreHandlerPackage` in the `smtpserver.xml` file.
```
<handlerchain coreHandlersPackage="com.linagora.tmail.smtp.TMailCmdHandlerLoader">
```
