:navtitle: LDAP mailing list

See xref:tmail-backend/features/ldapMailingLists.adoc[explanations] on LDAP mailing lists.

== Configuration

We integrated a working example onto the link:https://github.com/linagora/tmail-backend/tree/master/demo[Twake mail demo].

=== LDAPMailingList

Mailing list resolution for Twake mail based on LDAP groups.</p>

This mailet will look up mailAddress in order to identify groups and substitute their mail address with the ones of users.</p>

- mailingListPredicate: a heuristic to determine if a given mail address is likely to be a list
Specify `lists-prefix` for only mailAddress `abc@lists.domain.tld` to be considered lists and expended
Specify `any-local` to try to expend all local addresses which had a cost!
- baseDN: the base DN to use within group search. EG: ou=lists,dc=linagora,dc=com
- rejectedSenderProcessor: processor to handle rejected sender. Generally this consists of a bounce mailet explaining the
rejection.
- userMailCacheSize: Number of users DN to keep in the cache. This saves DN lookups on member to retrieve their mail address.
- userMailCacheDuration: Time during which one should keep entries into the user DN => mailAddress cache.
- mailAttributeForGroups: Attribute holding the mail address of a group. For easy testing this can be set to description
but for production use a special LDAP schema needs to be crafted for using the mail attribute.

Performance considerations:

- Sender validation goes faster if the email local part is also the user uid, as this heuristic saves precious LDAP lookups
- All DN lookups for retrieving mail address are cached for efficiency. This implies that email address changes for users
is a rare event, and we accept it to be non-synchronized for the duration of the cache retention when this happens
- LDAP groups composition and validation rules are never cached so far: addition of new users into a group will
thus be an instant operation.

Example:

....
<mailet match="All" class="com.linagora.tmail.mailet.LDAPMailingList">
    <baseDN>ou=lists,dc=tmail,dc=com</baseDN>
    <mailAttributeForGroups>description</mailAttributeForGroups>
    <rejectedSenderProcessor>rejectedSender</rejectedSenderProcessor>
</mailet>
....

=== IsALDAPMailingList

Matcher matching mailing lists defined by the LDAP.

Useful for integrating LDAP lists with Recipient Rewrite Tables: it can be used to re-process lists generated as
an output of RRTs.

Matcher argument needs to be in the form baseDN#groupObjectClass#mailAttribute

Sample usage:

....
<mailet match="com.linagora.tmail.mailet.IsALDAPMailingList=ou=lists,dc=tmail,dc=com#groupofnames#description" class="ToProcessor">
  <processor>transport</processor>
</mailet>
....

=== Valid RCPT Handling

Use either `TMailWithMailingListValidRcptHandler` or `NaiveTMailWithMailingListsValidRcptHandler` as a Valid RCPT handler in order to accept LDAP lists for incoming SMTP mails

- `TMailWithMailingListValidRcptHandler` performs a LDAP search onto each recipients
- `NaiveTMailWithMailingListsValidRcptHandler` relies on the syntax of the mail address (matches .*@lists.domain.tld) which
is cheaper but generates false positives.
