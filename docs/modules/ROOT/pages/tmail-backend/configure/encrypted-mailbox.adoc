== Enabling/Disabling the encrypted mailbox

Encrypting messages is costly thus we understand an administrator might choose not to enable this feature.

We provide an easy way to disable completely the **Encrypted Mailbox** through the configuration.

Example: `mailbox.properties`

....
gpg.encryption.enable=false
....
