:navtitle: Deleted message vault configuration

By default, on Tmail backend, the deleted message vault is enabled (contrary to James server where it is disabled).

TMail stores deleted message contents in a single blobstore bucket named `tmail-deleted-message-vault`. The garbage collection task also removes legacy time-based buckets if they exist.

It is still possible to disable it by modifying the following property on `deletedMessageVault.properties`:

....
enabled=false
