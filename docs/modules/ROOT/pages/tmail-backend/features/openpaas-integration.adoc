:navtitle: OpenPaaS Integration

https://docs.open-paas.org/[OpenPaaS], developed by Linagora, is a collaborative platform offering features such as calendar management, contact storage, and more. TMail integrates with OpenPaaS to offer integrations with OpenPaaS Calendar and address book.

This document describes the key integration points and functionality between TMail and OpenPaaS.

See xref:tmail-backend/configure/openpaas.adoc[this page for configuring the integration].

== Features
TMail provides the following functionalities:

- Adds recipients used by local users to their OpenPaaS collected contacts address book.
- Imports OpenPaaS contacts into the local auto-complete database.
- Integrates new events received by email into the OpenPaaS calendar.
- Updates attendance in the OpenPaaS calendar based on email event responses.

== Architecture and Implementation
=== Overview

TMail interacts with OpenPaaS through two main channels:

- RabbitMQ Messages.
- REST API Calls to the https://docs.open-paas.org/apis/web/[OpenPaaS API].

=== OpenPaas Contacts Consumption
TMail integrates with OpenPaaS to fetch contacts and index them. The `OpenPaasContactsConsumer` class handles contacts consumption by fetching contacts from OpenPaaS and indexing using `EmailAddressContactSearchEngine`.

This integration powers the auto-complete feature in TMail, allowing users to email their OpenPaaS contacts directly from TMail's compose screen.

=== Mail Attribute Forwarding
Another feature is the ability to forward mail attributes to a OpenPaas through an AMQP server. This is enabled by `OpenPaasAmqpForwardAttribute` mailet.

The integration uses the AMQP server configured in the `openpaas.properties` file.

=== Implementation Notes
Deploying OpenPaaS alongside TMail is not required, making the integration with OpenPaaS optional.

To create a TMail server with OpenPaaS integration, you need to enable the `OpenPaasModule`. This is achieved through the `OpenPaasModuleChooserConfiguration` class. The same approach can be used to disable OpenPaaS integration.
