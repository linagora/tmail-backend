TMail allows your users to store their emails encrypted in their mailbox, using the **GPG format**
(link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[RFC-4880 OpenPGP Message Format],
link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3156[RFC-3156 MIME Security with OpenPGP]).

Thus, TMail have **no means** to decrypt your messages once they are stored in the encrypted
mailbox. So be careful not to lose your private key: you would not be able to read your messages ever again! This also
means that, once encrypted, nobody else than you can ever read the messages!

You can read your emails through IMAP using compatible extensions like link:https://enigmail.net/index.php/en/[EnygMail].

Furthermore, we designed a xref:tmail-backend/jmap-extensions/jmapGpgExtension.adoc[JMAP GPG extension] to efficiently handle encrypted emails
within webMail or mobile applications. This extension encrypts separately the preview, the html body as well as attachments so
that the webMail / mobile application do not need to retrieve all the time the all message (it would be innefective to do so)
or parse MIME messages (complicated to do).

== Limitations

The messages are processed clear, where we do all the necessary treatments. Emails are only encrypted when stored in the
encrypted mailbox, not during the mail processing steps before. This means that an attacker eyes-dropping the email processing
will see emails in clear, but your emails are safe as soon as they land in your (encrypted) mailbox.

We do not encrypt email headers. A hacker might know who you send email to, as well as the topic of your email.

As we encrypted the content of the emails, we are not able to perform `content search` or encrypted emails. Your searches
will be limited to the headers of the email.

In order to ship an efficient JMAP extension (described above), we need to access the sturcture of the message (unencrypted).
This means that JMAP GPG extensions do not support GPG messages sent by third-parties. GPG messages sent by third parties can
still be read using IMAP extensions like EnygMail.

Key management still have to be performed manually by the user.

We will eventually work on lifting some of these restrictions.

== Activation

*Pre-requisite*: an administrator needs to enable the encrypted mailbox. This can easily be done via the `mailbox.properties` configuration file.

....
gpg.encryption.enable=true
....

Create a GPG keypair. This can be done via:

....
gpg --default-new-key-algo rsa4096 --gen-key
....

Upload your public key to the TMail backend using the Key management JMAP extension.

Example:

....
curl -XPOST http://james/jmap -d

{
  "using": ["urn:ietf:params:jmap:core", "com:linagora:params:jmap:pgp"],
  "methodCalls": [
    ["Keystore/set", {
      "accountId": "$ACCOUNT_ID",
      "create": {
        "K87": {
          "key": "$PGP_KEY_ARMORED"
        }
      }
    }, "c1"]
  ]
}
....

Doing so, your mails will be stored encrypted within your mailbox (even if the sender did not
encrypt them!).
