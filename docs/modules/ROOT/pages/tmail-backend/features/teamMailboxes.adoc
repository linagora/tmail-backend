Manage emails effectively as a team!

image::team-mailbox.jpg[Team mailboxes logo]

Team mailboxes enable everybody in the team:

- Emails are received on an email address dedicated to the team mailbox
- Members can read the emails received in the team mailbox. Everybody can manage these emails.
- Members can reply and send emails using the address of the team mailbox.

An example would be `marketting@linagora.com`.



== Configuring team mailboxes

An administrator needs to customize TMail configuration in order to benefit from Team mailboxes, namely:

 - Rely on the `TMailLocalDelivery` mailet in replacement of `apache/james-project` `LocalDelivery` mailet
in xref:james-distributed-app::configure/mailetcontainer.adoc[mailetcontainer.xml].
 - Rely on the `TMailValidRcptHandler` RCPT hook in replacement of `apache/james-project` `ValidRcptHandler` RCPT hook
in xref:james-distributed-app::configure/smtp.adoc[smtpserver.xml].

== Administrating team mailboxes

An administrator can manage team mailboxes using xref:tmail-backend/webadmin.adoc#_team_mailboxes[Team mailboxes webAdmin routes]:

- Creating/removing a team mailbox
- Listing team mailboxes of a domain
- Adding/removing/listing members of a team mailbox

Additionally, we provide xref:tmail-backend/webadmin.adoc#_team_mailboxes_quotas[Team mailboxes quota webAdmin routes] to
allow managing the quotas allocated to team mailboxes.

== Using team mailboxes via JMAP

Team mailboxes require the use of `urn:apache:james:params:jmap:mail:shares`. This allows contextualizing mailboxes as part of
`Mailbox/get` operations.

We introduce a xref:tmail-backend/jmap-extensions/index.adoc#_additions_to_urnapachejamesparamsjmapmailshares[TeamMailbox namespace] to
the `urn:apache:james:params:jmap:mail:shares` JMAP extension.

== Limitation of Team Mailboxes

Team mailboxes MVP does not include, as of today:

 - Fine grain right management for members. As of today a member can read, write, delete email and send replies without any
limitation possible. We might introduce member profiles in the future to limit their rights.
 - Delegate members administration to a member. Today all new members need to be added through webAdmin. We might introduce
administration right management for members with a JMAP extension for it.
 - Exposing the Team mailboxes via IMAP. So far, this is a JMAP only feature.
 - Sub mailboxes management. Today team mailboxes only have a `INBOX` and a `Sent` mailboxes. We could allow users in the
future to create their own sub-mailboxes for team mailboxes in order to allow finer grain classification of emails.
 - The keyword of emails in team mailboxes (`seen`, `Flagged`, `Answered`, `Forwarded`) are common to all users. This comes
from James storage structure and will likely not change.
