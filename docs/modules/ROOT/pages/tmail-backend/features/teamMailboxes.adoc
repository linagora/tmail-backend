Manage emails effectively as a team!

Team mailboxes enable everybody in the team:

- Emails are received on an email address dedicated to the team mailbox
- Members can read the emails received in the team mailbox. Everybody can manage these emails.
- Members can reply and send emails using the address of the team mailbox.

An example would be `marketting@linagora.com`.
