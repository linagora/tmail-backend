Manage emails effectively as a team!

Functional mailboxes enable everybody in the team:

- Emails are received on an email address dedicated to the functional mailbox
- Members can read the emails received in the functional mailbox. Everybody can manage these emails.
- Members can reply and send emails using the address of the functional mailbox.

An example would be `marketting@linagora.com`.
