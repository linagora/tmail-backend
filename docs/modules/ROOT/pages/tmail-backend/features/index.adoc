TMail offers a number of essential advanced features, amongst them:

== The Encrypted mailbox

TMail allows your users to store their emails encrypted in their mailbox, using the **GPG format**
(link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[RFC-4880 OpenPGP Message Format],
link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3156[RFC-3156 MIME Security with OpenPGP]).

Thus, TMail has **no means** to decrypt your messages once they are stored in the encrypted
mailbox. So be careful not to loose your private key: you would not be able to read your messages ever again! This also
means that, once encrypted, nobody else than you can ever read the messages!
