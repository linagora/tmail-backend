TMail offers a number of essential advanced features, amongst them:

== The Encrypted mailbox

TMail allows your users to store their emails encrypted in their mailbox, using the **GPG format**
(link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[RFC-4880 OpenPGP Message Format],
link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3156[RFC-3156 MIME Security with OpenPGP]).

Thus, TMail has **no means** to decrypt your messages once they are stored in the encrypted
mailbox. So be careful not to loose your private key: you would not be able to read your messages ever again! This also
means that, once encrypted, nobody else than you can ever read the messages!

Team mailboxes enable everybody in the team:

 - Emails are received on an email address dedicated to the team mailbox
 - Members can read the emails received in the team mailbox. Everybody can manage these emails.
 - Members can reply and send emails using the address of the team mailbox.

An example would be `marketting@linagora.com`.

== Contact autocomplete

TMail allows users to have an easy and performant contact autocomplete experience.

A contact must be composed of an email address, but can also have optionally a firstname and surname.

Contacts can be stored in many ways in TMail:

- storing recipients as personal contacts when sending a mail via a mailet
- synchronisation with LDAP for all domain contacts via a LSC script
- synchronization with external third-party contact app via RabbitMQ

The user is able to autocomplete over his personal contacts and domain contacts via a JMAP method.
