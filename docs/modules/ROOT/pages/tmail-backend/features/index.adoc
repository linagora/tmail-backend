TMail offers a number of essential advanced features, amongst them:

== The Encrypted mailbox

image::lock.png[Lock logo]

TMail allows your users to store their emails encrypted in their mailbox, using the **GPG format**
(link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[RFC-4880 OpenPGP Message Format],
link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3156[RFC-3156 MIME Security with OpenPGP]).

Thus, TMail has **no means** to decrypt your messages once they are stored in the encrypted
mailbox. So be careful not to loose your private key: you would not be able to read your messages ever again! This also
means that, once encrypted, nobody else than you can ever read the messages!

TMail allows users to configure their account to forward mails to other mail addresses via JMAP methods.

This simple feature can be useful when one of your users is on vacation or leaves your organization then it's easier
to just forward emails in some cases to other people that can treat them.

Users can also decide to keep a local copy of the forwarded mails.
